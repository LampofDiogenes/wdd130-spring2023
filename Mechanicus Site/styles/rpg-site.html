    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/2a7f62-2a2d34-7f7caf-fffffc-d80032"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/2a7f62-2a2d34-7f7caf-fffffc-d80032</a>

        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">[#2A2D34]</td>
        <td class="secondary">[#A42212]</td>

    <p>
      Hello Adventurer! This site is going to be a hub for all available rpg games that we can access.
      We hope that you enjoy the site, and be sure to tell your friends about this to help spread awareness
      about these amazing RPGs
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      The RPGs that I hope to include will be a link to pathfinder, some links to wikidot for 5e (and
      catagorizing it to make it a lot more easy to navigate), dark heresy, and any others that we can pick 
      up.

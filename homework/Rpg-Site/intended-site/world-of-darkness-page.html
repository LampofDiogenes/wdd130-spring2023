    <h2>World of Darkness</h2>
    <p>
        World of Darkness is a world in which werewolves, vampires, and All
        things that go bump in the night live. However, what makes this setting
        special is that all these creatures all exist within our normal world.
        Ever see a light that flickers in the night eeriely? Ever heard a howl
        in the woods when at night? Ever wanted to play with the supernatural
        in a role-playing setting? Then World of Darkness is for you!
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: World of Darkness is a setting where the stakes are high, And
        characters have a high likely-hood of dying if in combat. If you are 
        an interested DM, please note this and plan around it.

      <h3>Fighter</h3>
      <p>A fighter is a martial class. This is a general class, which is good at most things, but 
        not particularly exceptional in any one thing.
      </p>
      <p>As a fighter, you gain the following class features.

    <p>Hit Points</p>
    <p>Hit Dice: 1d10 per fighter level</p>
    <p>Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier</p>
    <p>Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per fighter level after 1st</p>

    <p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>
    <p>Armor: All armor, shields</p>
    <p>Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons</p>
    <p>Tools: None</p>
    <p>Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution</p>
    <p>Skills: Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival</p>

    <p><b>Equipment</b></p>
    <p>(a) chain mail or (b) leather, longbow, and 20 arrows</p>
    <p>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</p>
    <p>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) two handaxes</p>
    <p>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</p>
    <p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>
    <p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>

    <p><ins>Archery.</ins> You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
    <p><ins>Blind Fighting.</ins> You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</p>
    <p><ins>Defense.</ins> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
    <p><ins>Dueling.</ins> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
    <p><ins>Great Weapon Fighting.</ins> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
    <p><ins>Interception.</ins> When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</p>
    <p><ins>Protection.</ins> When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p>
    <p><ins>Superior Technique.</ins> You learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice.)
    You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
    <p><ins>Thrown Weapon Fighting.</ins> You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
    In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</p>
    <p><ins>Two-Weapon Fighting.</ins> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
    <p><ins>Unarmed Fighting.</ins> Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
    At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.</p>
    <p><ins>Close Quarters Shooter (UA).</ins> When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.</p>
    <p><ins>Mariner (UA).</ins> As long as you are not wearing heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your normal speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to armor class.</p>
    <p><ins>Tunnel Fighter (UA).</ins> As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach.</p>
    <p><b>Second Wind</b></p>
    <p>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.</p>

    Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

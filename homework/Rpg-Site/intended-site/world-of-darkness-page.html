    <h2>World of Darkness</h2>
    <p>
        World of Darkness is a world in which werewolves, vampires, and All
        things that go bump in the night live. However, what makes this setting
        special is that all these creatures all exist within our normal world.
        Ever see a light that flickers in the night eeriely? Ever heard a howl
        in the woods when at night? Ever wanted to play with the supernatural
        in a role-playing setting? Then World of Darkness is for you!
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: World of Darkness is a setting where the stakes are high, And
        characters have a high likely-hood of dying if in combat. If you are 
        an interested DM, please note this and plan around it.
    </p>

    <div id="combat-awareness" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>Combat Awareness * *</h3>
      <p>Prerequisite: Military Training or Background</p>
      <p>Effect: Your character understands how to survive on a battlefield as a result of either intense military
        training or personal experience. This includes knowledge of how to use terrain to your advantage and a
        general state of mental alertness sustainable even under heavy enemy fire. As a result of this aptitude, your
        character gains a +2 dice bonus to any situational awareness roll.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div id="common-sense" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Common Sense * * * *</h3>
        <p>Prerequisite: Only available during character creation</p>
        <p>Effect: The Storyteller can make a reflexive Wits + Composure roll once per chapter for your character if he is
            about to embark on a disastrous course of action, or if you find yourself at a point in the story where you are
            completely stumped for ideas. If the roll succeeds, the Storyteller may point out the risks of a particular
            course, or suggest possible actions that your character can take that might get events back on track. Note:
            While you are free to ask the Storyteller for a Common Sense roll when you’re out of ideas, he is under no
            obligation to comply. It an aid, not a crutch. Available at character creation only. 
  
        </p>
  
      </div>

    <div id="danger-sense" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Danger Sense * *</h3>
        <p>Prerequisite: None</p>
        <p>Effect: You gain a +2 modifier on reflexive Wits + Composure rolls for your character to detect an
            impending ambush. This kind of roll is typically made prior to the first turn of a surprise attack.
            Your character has a well-developed survival instinct that warns him of impending danger. Perhaps he’s
            adept at reading subtle clues in his environment orhe possesses an uncanny “sixth sense” when it comes to
            avoiding trouble.
  
        </p>
  
      </div>

    <div id="eidetic-memory" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Eidetic Memory * *</h3>
        <p>Prerequisite: Available at Charater creation only</p>
        <p>Effect:Your character has a near-photographic memory, being able to recall vast amounts of observed
            detail with astonishing accuracy. You do not normally need to make a roll for your character to remember an
            obscure fact or past experience, unless he is under stress (such as in combat). Under stress, there is a +2
            modifier on any Intelligence + Composure or other Skill based roll (say, Academics, to remember a fact) for
            memory recall. Available at character creation only.
